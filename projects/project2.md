## AI Agent Visualization 🎮🤖

## 🔬 Brief Project Flow 📝

Since we have no access to the internal control for Clash Royale, so that no direct information to extract state, action, and reward for traditional online training in Reinforcement Learning. We have to build the visual detection block to extract the necessary information for training data. 

1. **Dataset/Episode Collection 📸**
   - 1.1 Use [Scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy) and **FFmpeg** to access the Android phone screen and extract the game episode frames (later add the link for the dataset collection). Notice we have to use the Expert datasets.
   
   - 1.2 Prepare troops segments for generative arena images, which is the training dataset for visual detection model YOLOv8:

3. **Visual Detection/ Data Processing 🔍**
   - 2.1 **State builder** (torch_state_builder.py): Use trained YOLOv8 for arena information extraction to build state **s**, use ResNet classification to extract info for deployed cards and elixir, use cnocr to extract actual time.
   
   - 2.2 **Action builder** (torch_action_builder.py): Use ResNet classification to visually detect card deployments.
   
   - 2.3 **Reward builder** (torch_reward_builder.py): Use cnocr to detect queen and king tower HP deduction.
   
   - 2.4 Every frame would have the corresponding state (s) 🟢, action (a) ⚡, and reward (r) ⭐

4. **Policy Network Construction 🧠**

## Training Dataset Construction 🗂️

1. The keys of **state (s)** are [arena, cards, elixir]. The trained YOLO model gives inference on arena detection results and detected troops with keys [position, class, belongings]. The ResNet model detects the cards table, showing only 4 cards at a time. cnocr detects remaining elixir.

2. The keys of **action (a)** are [select, pos] representing selected cards and deployment positions in the arena. The arena is divided into 32x18 sub-blocks.

3. The key of **reward (r)** is the scalar reward 🏅. Positive reward if opposite tower HP is reduced, negative otherwise.

4. Dataloading process: each timestep t has (s, a, r) pairs. The sequential construction is necessary for transformer decoder model.
   - Sequential Dataloader: Each sequence is length n (ex. 30), with the first 29 input pairs predicting the 30th pair.

5. **Sparse Action Addressing ⚡**

The actual action frames get higher weights 🏋️‍♂️, and neighboring frames get decaying weights.
